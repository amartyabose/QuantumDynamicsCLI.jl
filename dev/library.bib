  abstract = {A formalism has been developed, using Feynman's space-time formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics whereby the behavior of a system of interest, which is coupled to other external quantum systems, may be calculated in terms of its own variables only. It is shown that the effect of the external systems in such a formalism can always be included in a general class of functionals (influence functionals) of the coordinates of the system only. The properties of influence functionals for general systems are examined. Then, specific forms of influence functionals representing the effect of definite and random classical forces, linear dissipative systems at finite temperatures, and combinations of these are analyzed in detail. The linear system analysis is first done for perfectly linear systems composed of combinations of harmonic oscillators, loss being introduced by continuous distributions of oscillators. Then approximately linear systems and restrictions necessary for the linear behavior are considered. Influence functionals for all linear systems are shown to have the same form in terms of their classical response functions. In addition, a fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived relating temperature and dissipation of the linear system to a fluctuating classical potential acting on the system of interest which reduces to the Nyquist-Johnson relation for noise in the case of electric circuits. Sample calculations of transition probabilities for the spontaneous emission of an atom in free space and in a cavity are made. Finally, a theorem is proved showing that within the requirements of linearity all sources of noise or quantum fluctuation introduced by maser-type amplification devices are accounted for by a classical calculation of the characteristics of the maser.},

  abstract = {For common condensed phase problems described by a low-dimensional system coupled to a harmonic bath, Feynman's path integral formulation of time-dependent quantum mechanics leads to expressions for the reduced density matrix of the system where the effects of the harmonic environment enter through an influence functional that is nonlocal in time. In a recent Letter [Chem. Phys. Lett. 221, 482 (1994)], we demonstrated that the range of the nonlocal interactions is finite even at zero temperature, such that the nonlocal kernel extends over only a few time steps if the path integral is expressed in terms of accurate quasiadiabatic propagators. This feature arises from disruption of phase coherence in macroscopic environments and leads to Markovian dynamics for an augmented reduced density tensor, permitting iterative time evolution schemes. In the present paper we analyze the structure and properties of the relevant tensor propagator. Specifically, we show that the tensor multiplication scheme rigorously conserves the trace of the reduced density matrix, and that in cases of short-range nonlocality it leads to Redfield-type equations which are correct to all orders in perturbation theory and which take into account memory effects. We also argue that a simple eigenvector analysis reveals (without actual iteration) the nature of the dynamics and of the equilibrium state, and directly yields quantum reaction or relaxation rates.},

  abstract = {In a recent Letter [Chem. Phys. Lett. 221, 482 (1994)], we demonstrated that the dynamics of reduced density matrices for systems in contact with dissipative harmonic environments can be obtained in an iterative fashion by multiplication of a propagator tensor. The feasibility of iterative procedures in reduced dimension spaces arises from intrinsic features of the dissipative influence functional in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum dynamics. Specifically, the continuum of frequencies characteristic of broad condensed phase spectra disrupts phase coherence to a large extent, such that the dynamics of an augmented reduced density tensor becomes Markovian. In a preceding article [J. Chem. Phys. 102, 4600 (1995)] we examined in detail the formal properties of the tensor propagator. In the present paper we show that the tensor propagator can be further decomposed into a product of small rank tensors, resulting in an extremely simple and efficient numerical scheme that scales almost linearly with the dimension of the augmented reduced density tensor. Numerical application to a model electron transfer reaction is presented.},

  abstract = {The real-time path integral representation of the reduced density matrix for a discrete system in contact with a dissipative medium is rewritten in terms of the number of blips, i.e., elementary time intervals over which the forward and backward paths are not identical. For a given set of blips, it is shown that the path sum with respect to the coordinates of all remaining time points is isomorphic to that for the wavefunction of a system subject to an external driving term and thus can be summed by an inexpensive iterative procedure. This exact decomposition reduces the number of terms by a factor that increases exponentially with propagation time. Further, under conditions (moderately high temperature and/or dissipation strength) that lead primarily to incoherent dynamics, the ``fully incoherent limit'' zero-blip term of the series provides a reasonable approximation to the dynamics, and the blip series converges rapidly to the exact result. Retention of only the blips required for satisfactory convergence leads to speedup of full-memory path integral calculations by many orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {In order to model realistic quantum devices it is necessary to simulate quantum systems strongly coupled to their environment. To date, most understanding of open quantum systems is restricted either to weak system--bath couplings or to special cases where specific numerical techniques become effective. Here we present a general and yet exact numerical approach that efficiently describes the time evolution of a quantum system coupled to a non-Markovian harmonic environment. Our method relies on expressing the system state and its propagator as a matrix product state and operator, respectively, and using a singular value decomposition to compress the description of the state as time evolves. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our approach by numerically identifying the localisation transition of the Ohmic spin-boson model, and considering a model with widely separated environmental timescales arising for a pair of spins embedded in a common environment.},

  abstract = {It has been recently shown how the tensorial nature of real-time path integrals (PIs) involving the Feynman-Vernon influence functional can be utilized with matrix product states, taking advantage of the finite length of the bath-induced memory. Tensor networks (TNs) promise to provide a unified language to express the structure of a PI. Here, a generalized TN specifically incorporating the pairwise interaction structure of the influence functional and its invariance with respect to the average forward-backward position or the sojourn value in the form of the blip representation is derived and implemented. This pairwise connected TNPI (PC-TNPI) is illustrated through applications to typical spin-boson problems and explorations of the differences caused by the exact form of the spectral density. The storage and performance scalings are reported, showing the compactness of the representation and the efficiency of the contraction process. Finally, taking advantage of the compressed representation, the viability of using PC-TNPI for simulating multistate problems is demonstrated. The PC-TNPI structure can be shown to yield other TN algorithms currently in use. Consequently, it should be possible to use it as a starting point for deriving other optimized procedures.},

  abstract = {A general formulation is given to the quantum theory of steady diffusion. In seeking for a steady solution of Liouville's equation, the boundary condition is taken into account by requiring that the solution should lead to a given distribution of average density. The distribution is to be determined by macroscopic law of diffusion and macroscopic boundary condition. The basic equation thus obtained has a form similar to Bloch's kinetic equation and reduces to the latter in the limit of a system of weakly interacting particles. This is shown by generalizing a demping theoretical expansion of Kohn and Luttinger. It is found that the Einstein relation is valid only for the symmetric part of diffusion- and electric conductivity tensors, in agreement with Kasuya's suggestion.},

  abstract = {The initial stages of the evolution of an open quantum system encode the key information of its underlying dynamical correlations, which in turn can predict the trajectory at later stages. We propose a general approach based on non-Markovian dynamical maps to extract this information from the initial trajectories and compress it into non-Markovian transfer tensors. Assuming time-translational invariance, the tensors can be used to accurately and efficiently propagate the state of the system to arbitrarily long time scales. The non-Markovian transfer tensor method (TTM) demonstrates the coherent-to-incoherent transition as a function of the strength of quantum dissipation and predicts the noncanonical equilibrium distribution due to the system-bath entanglement. TTM is equivalent to solving the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation and, therefore, can be used to reconstruct the dynamical operators (the system Hamiltonian and memory kernel) from quantum trajectories obtained in simulations or experiments. The concept underlying the approach can be generalized to physical observables with the goal of learning and manipulating the trajectories of an open quantum system.},
